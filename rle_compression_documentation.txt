The program requests as input a sequence of bits as a string, immediately after that a counter is initialized that will count the occurrences of the bits and then a list of result variables. Next a for loop is initialized that iterates for the length of the bit sequence, within the loop
a comparison is made, i.e., if the value of the sequence at the i-th position is equal to the value at the i-th position + 1, then the count is incremented by 1, but as soon as this condition is false the following string is added to the result list:f"{count}*{sequence[i]}," basically the number of times the i-th bit appears.
All this is repeated throughout the length of the sequence. But the code, at each execution, generates an error, that is, List out of range. But thanks to the try exection it doesn't happen when using the notation x[i] == x[i+1] often the loop iterates for n-1, but if I make it iterate for n-1 in the case where the last bit is different from the penultimate bit it doesn't occur
from the penultimate will not be counted in the list because the scrolling of the list would stop only at the penultimate element; using the try exception this does not happen and thus all problems are solved.
